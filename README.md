Project Title: travel-site  
This is my version of the travel-site example of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow.  
Initially, the files from https://github.com/LearnWebCode/travel-site-files were cloned as a starting point.  

Getting Started:  
1) go to directory where remote repo should be copied to  
2) git clone https://github.com/hakunamatatata/travel-site.git  

Prerequisites  
You need an environment with Node, gulp-cli and npm installed. 

Installing  
After installing Node and npm, you can simply run npm install, and in theory, this should install all required packages in package.json.  

Run the project using gulp watch  
The command "gulp watch" will launch index.html (located in the app folder) in our standard browser.  

Test  
Check console output to confirm no errors occurred after running npm install.  

Built With  
Node  
GULP  
postcss
