Project Title: travel-site  
This is my version of the travel-site example of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow.  
Initially, the files from https://github.com/LearnWebCode/travel-site-files were cloned as a starting point.  

Getting Started:  
1) go to directory where remote repo should be copied to  
2) git clone https://github.com/hakunamatatata/travel-site.git  

Prerequisites  
You need an environment with GULP and Node installed. A detailed list of dependencies can be found here:   https://github.com/hakunamatatata/travel-site/blob/master/package.json  

Installing  
After installing Node and Gulp, you can simply copy the file package.json to your environment and run npm install, in theory it should install all required packages.  

Run the project using gulp watch  
The command "gulp watch" will launch index.html (located in the app folder) in our standard browser.  

Test  
Check console output to confirm no errors occurred after running npm install.  

Built With  
Node  
GULP
