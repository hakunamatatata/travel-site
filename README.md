Project Title: travel-site  
This is my version of the travel-site example of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow.  
Initially, the files from https://github.com/LearnWebCode/travel-site-files were cloned as a starting point.  

Getting Started:  
1) go to directory where remote repo should be copied to  
2) git clone https://github.com/hakunamatatata/travel-site.git  

Prerequisites  
You need an environment with Node, gulp-cli and npm installed.

Installing  
After installing all that, you can simply run npm install, and in theory, this should install all required packages in package.json.  

Run the project using the command "gulp watch". Open the IP and port as instructed in the terminal.
The gulp task "icons" (running gulp icons) generates one svg file for all icons and a corresponding _sprite.css file. You can run that by typing "gulp icons".

Test  
Check console output to confirm no errors occurred after running npm install.  

Built With  
Node
GULP and various packages like postcss
